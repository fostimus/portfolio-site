I love to solve problems, and I love to meet people. Becoming a Full-Stack Developer was the marriage of those two loves. Through the medium of code I solve problems; and by working on multiple projects, I get to meet new people very often. I almost always feel like there isn't enough time for me to facilitate the projects I take on and the relationships I both form and maintain, which leads me to my third love: productivity.


Between those 3 P's (problems, people, & productivity), I fit in various interests, hobbies and passion projects (4th and 5th P's maybe?). I'm unapologetically Southern Californian, so I'll refer to my interests as I normally would.


I'm a huge NBA junkie, with the undisputed best team in the league (hint: 2020 Champs ðŸ˜Œ) being my favorite team. I play pick up as often as I can, but when I'm not you can find me at the gym lifting weights to pump-up dance music. Lastly, I'm an avid anime fan; One Piece, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Gurren Lagann are my favorites, and each are s i c k (sorry, SoCal slang. Told you I'd do it!). Talking about anime brings me to one of my passion projects: learning Japanese!
