# My First Post

Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you; I'm very much in charge. Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover. These 2 halves don't belong together, bitch! I'm your worst nightmare, bitch! Me irresponsible? All I wanted was for you to hand me a screwdriver! But instead you had me buckle down and make you a roofie juice serum, so you can roofie that poor girl at your school. W-w-w-w--are you kidding me, Morty?! You're really gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y'know your-you're a little creep, Morty! Your-your-your-you're just a little creepy creep person!

You're talking about Inception? Awww, bitch! Listen to your sister Morty; to live is to risk it all; otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there, how much of that did you hear? We are created to serve a singular purpose, for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!
