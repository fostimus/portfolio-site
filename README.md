# Improvements/To-Do's

-   Use `@media` queries to do some creative swapping of styles to site.
-   Separate content from HTML (maybe EJS/templates?)

## Notes

-   Developing with less.js locally has issues with Chrome. You either need to:
    1.  Run chrome with the command line switch "-â€“allow-file-access-from-files"
    2.  Serve less.js from a local web server. This is the safer, but more involved, option.
