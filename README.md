# Improvements/To-Do's

-   Need to make about page responsive
-   Switch to CMS instead of `/content` folder
-   Button light theme - unable to see on the footer
-   use `next-sitemap` to generate sitemap for blog

# Blog notes/considerations

-   Be sure to link to other places where relevant
-   Leverage keywords - both in tags, and throughout article/blog post
-   find tail keywords - essentially related keywords (e.g. React props, React state, React context)
